Note:
For the module to correctly load, you must make sure that the number of runtime uarts are high enough configured.
You can do this in the kernel by setting:
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS or: 8250.nr_uarts as a boot time parameter
to a value at least 5 higher than the usual 4 that are reserved for the base system.
This number must be lower than:
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS

The defaults for these are 32 and 4, distribution kernels usually set it much higher.
(ubuntu uses 48/32)
